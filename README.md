**Motivation:**
This was my first time ever working with Angular, Tailwind, and ASP. During my summer class of 2023, we were given the task to make a Volunteer Management System, Client/Server application, in 6 weeks. I took this as the perfect oppurtinity to learn both Angular for the front end and ASP for th backend. 

It was very challenging since Ive always worked with CLI programs but with enough grit, passion, and curiosity we were able to finish the assignment with an A.

**Tools Used:** Angular, Tailwind, ASP.net

**Supplementing Projects:** [Volunteer Management API](https://github.com/H4CKM11/Volunteer_API)
